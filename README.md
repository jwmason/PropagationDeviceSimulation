# PropagationDeviceSimulation

This program simulates the behavior of a distributed system composed of interconnected devices.
The simulation models how alerts and cancellations are propagated between devices over a simulated
period. Alerts are raised by devices, propagated through a network of devices, and canceled once the
issue is resolved. The simulation provides insights into how distributed systems behave without the
need for physical devices and networks.
